<h3> Mass media   </h3>
<h4> Mass media, which include broadcast (radio and television) and print remain the most popular communication way to reach large audiences due to its availability and wide coverage.

<h4>Print media include newspapers, magazines, brochures, pamphlets, catalogues, journals, and such like.

Print media remain important to the dissemination of information that serves as a resource artifact of history. It is a quantifiable and easily accessible source of historical information, and that is something we purchase and own, as opposed to television and radio programs  </h4> <br>

<h3>Radio   </h3>
<h4> Even before TV collected the imaginations of the Filipinos; radio was yet another source of information and entertainment. Because of its lower cost compared to television, radio is used for both commercial and developmental purposes, particularly in rural communities. Even in modern times, with the threat of calamities, radio has once again proved its worth in delivering information directly, as compared to television. Radio can also be enjoyed everywhere and has achieved a higher level of loyalty to the viewers who will always be tuned in to their programs.  </h4> <br>

<h3> Television   </h3>
<h4>The advantage of television compared with the other two forms of media is its audio-visual capacity. It is designed, by its natural world, to attract the attention of the audience for just a short period of time, which means that the messages destined for this medium should be catchy, convincing, and attentive. In today's modern media landscape, reality TV is becoming the main feature for news, entertainment, and education; its influence has also been explained, debated, and even studied by scholars.  </h4> <br>

<h3> New Media  </h3>
<h4> As major aspect of the telecommunications network, the Internet is perhaps the most essential part of the convergence puzzle. It is a vehicle that can incorporate all the other forms of media. Moreover, the feedback capability of Internet is considered as one of its most attractive and essential features. Although there are many issues concerning the use of Internet in terms of impact, abuse, privacy, credibility, and accessibility, it cannot be denied that the communications industry, as well as its audience, has grown radically due to the Internet </h4> <br>
