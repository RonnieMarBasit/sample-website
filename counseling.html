<h3.7> Counseling is a professional service provided by trained counselors to help individuals, couples, families, or groups navigate through personal, emotional, social, or psychological difficulties. 
Counseling typically involves a collaborative relationship between the counselor and the client. The counselor creates a non-judgmental and empathetic space for clients to share their experiences and concerns. Through active listening, open-ended questions, and various therapeutic techniques, counselors help clients gain insight into their challenges, develop coping strategies, and make informed decisions about their lives.
Counseling can address a wide range of issues, including mental health concerns, relationship problems, stress management, grief and loss, self-esteem issues, career challenges, and personal growth. </h3.7>

<h2> A.Behavioral Approach  </h2>
<h3.5> This therapy is based on the belief that behavior is learnt in response to past experiences and can be unlearnt, or reconditioned, without analyzing the past to find the reason for the behavior. It works well for compulsive and obsessive behavior, fears, phobias, and addictions. <br>
This contends that learning happens when aparticular behavior is reinforced by the presence of a reward or discouraged by either giving a punishment or removing a potential reward. <br>
Behaviors that are rewarded tend to be performed more frequently. On the other hand, behaviors thatare not rewarded decrease in occurrence. At the same time, behaviors that receive punishment either increase or decrease in occurrence. </h3.5>
<h3> Token Economy  </h3>

Adlerian counselors help clients look at their lifestyle and personal values to help them understand and question their usual patterns of behavior and hidden goals. It is by learning process that assist client to move towards useful involvement and contribution to society. <br>
The primary goal of this approach is to recognizeand understand the objective reasons for one’s experiences. These reasons may be differentfrom the perspective of the client or how theclients view their lives. <br>
 The techniques used aim to improveinterpersonal relationships and self-awareness.</h3.5> 
<h3> I-Messages  </h3>
<h3.5 This technique called responsibility messages prods the client to take responsibility for his or her feelings, behaviors,or attitudes. <br>
Acknowledgement of  one’s responsibility allows for an expression of the other person or the other party’s side, thus facilitating an open and respectful communication. <br>
 This is non-threatening because it only involves the client making the statement; hence, it can be used in situations when communicating with another person, who is either defensive or starting a more complicated problem. </h3.5> 

<h3> Acting As-if </h3>
<h3.5  This technique facilitates change not only in the client’s  perception about a particular experiencebut also in improving his or her actions or behaviors. Having such change perspective leads to increased functioning. It was believedthat people act as if what they believe is true, yetit has always been proven that not everything we believe in ourselves is real. </h3.5> 

<h2> D. Gestalt Approach   </h2>
<h3.5> The name is derived from the German for "organized whole". Developed by Fritz Perls, if focuses on the whole of the client's experience, including feelings, thoughts, and actions. The client gains self-awareness in the 'here and now' by analyzing behavior and body language talking about bottled up feelings. This approach often includes acting out scenarios and dream recall. <br>
Gestalt means “a structured, meaningful unity that stands out against a background in the organism/environment field”  <br>
This suggests that thisapproach focuses on present moment experiences,existential meaning, interpersonal relationships andintegration of the whole person.  <br>
 The Gestalt approach intends to help th clients understand the meaning and purpose of their experiences by increasing their awareness of what ishappening in the present moment. </h3.5> 

<h3>  Empty Chair
  </h3>
<h3.5>  This technique aims to help the counselee to play what he or shewould likely to say or to act toward another person. <br>
 The counselee, consequently, would also be asked to play whatthe other person would say to or act toward him or her. <br>
 By expressing both sides of the issue, the counselee canreconcile conflicts between his or her values, thoughts, feelings and actions. <br>
 The counselor facilitates the interplay of both sides as the counselee explores the issues. </h3.5>

<h2> E. Solution-Focused Brief Counseling (SFBC)
   </h2>
<h3.5>  Instead of focusing on the client’s problem, this approach focuses on the solution that works best for the client. <br>
 This approach proposes that:
(1) when clients concentrate on success, it will lead to positive change;(2) by determining moments or occasions when symptoms do not occur,clients are given the opportunity to generate solutions;(3) clients must trust that small positive changes can facilitate bigger changes;(4) all clients have the capacity to solve their problems particularly during theabsence of symptoms; and(5) clients must identify goals that are positive and measurable. </h3.5>

<h3> Scaling   </h3>
<h3.5>  Scaling quickly assesses or gauges the client’s progress. <br>
 It simply presents the client a 10-pointcontinuum where he or she is asked to rate aparticular concern.For example, the counselor will say, <br>
“If  1 means sadness and 10 is happiness, what rating will you give to how you feel now?”  </h3.5>

<h3>  Exception </h3>
<h3.5>  A counselor explores situations or moments when the problem was not occurring. SFBC comes from the assumption that all concerns have exclusions, which are moments that canbe used to generate possible solutions, sources of strengths, and personal resources.   </h3.5>

<h3> Miracle Questioning   </h3>
<h3.5>   This technique shifts from a problem-focused way of dealing with their difficulties to a solution-focused one. <br>
 It prompts clients to think of what they really want andwhat this entails to do so, or what is needed to do what he or she wants.  <br>
 However it requires the clients to detail evidence of the absence of his or her problem, making the goals that the counselee really wants clearer and more detailed.   </h3.5>

<h2>  F. Social Learning Approach  </h2>
<h3.5> This approach suggests that clients learn to dotheir tasks and behaviors by simply observingand imitating others. Studies have shown thatindividuals do not just execute a behavior. Individuals can think and plan their actionsbefore executing it. From here, a number of techniques were developed.   </h3.5>

<h3>  Modeling  </h3>
<h3.5>  Also known as  imitation, identification, observational learning and vicarious learning. <br>
 It emphasizes that an individual’s behaviors are learned from observing amodel or someone whom we see around by imitating their behaviors. </h3.5>

<h2>  G. Mindfulness-Based Counseling  </h2>
<h3.5> “refers to a process that leads to a mental state characterized by nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment experience, including one’s sensations, thoughts, bodily states, consciousness, and the environment while encouraging openness, curiosity, and acceptance” (Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010, p. 169).   </h3.5> <br>
<br> <h3.5> The client pays attention to their feelings and thoughts in the moment, without judgment. Following Buddhist traditions, it is an open minded and accepting way of responding to thoughts (Kabat-Zinn, 2005). <br>
Mindfulness-Based Counseling is an increasingly popular approach aimed at helping clients to increase relaxation while removing negative or stressful judgments. This technique helps to teach clients how to deal with emotional stressors reflectively instead of reflexively (Hofmann et al., 2010). <br>
Different types of mindfulness meditation approaches may be applied as part of Mindfulness Counseling, such as yoga, breathing meditation, sitting meditation, body scan, and sound scan. <br> </h3.5>

<h2> H. Eclectic Counseling
   </h2>
